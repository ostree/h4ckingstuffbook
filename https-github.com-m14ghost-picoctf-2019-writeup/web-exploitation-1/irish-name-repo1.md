## Question

There is a website running at [https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37868/](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37868/) \(link\) or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37868](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37868). Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hint

There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

Try to think about how does the website verify your login?

## Solution

This is a SQL injection vul.

```bash
Username:       ' OR 'A' = 'A' -- 
or another one: ' OR 1 --
```

Then click to Login buttom to see the flag
