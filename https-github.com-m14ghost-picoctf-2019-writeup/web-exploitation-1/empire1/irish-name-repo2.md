## Question

There is a website running at [https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/40968/](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/40968/) [\(link\)](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/40968/). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:40968](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:40968)

## Hint

The password is being filtered.

## Solution

The first time we've try with this

```bash
Username:       ' OR 'A' = 'A' --
```

=&gt; SQLi detected.

Try Username with `admin' --`, then we've got the flag
