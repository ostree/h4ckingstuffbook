## Question

This should be easy. Overflow the correct buffer in this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/47d8208dec3e309d6e065488ece7bec3/vuln) and get a flag. Its also found in /problems/overflow-0\_2\_20c7eb49602df3c04c1f43bf9aff1faa on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/47d8208dec3e309d6e065488ece7bec3/vuln.c).

## Hint

* Find a way to trigger the flag to print
* If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

## Solution

Exploit: `./vuln aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`

## Flag
